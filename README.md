With a robust industrial background, I specialize in designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining diverse web and mobile applications. My expertise spans across Angular, Ionic, and NodeJS, coupled with a proficiency in AWS-Amplify for cloud-based deployments.

I'm dedicated to enhancing app load time, performance, and accessibility in Angular web applications, aiming to create user-friendly and efficient software accessible to diverse audiences. Seeking opportunities to engage with versatile technologies is my passion. Understanding the mechanics beneath the surface drives my curiosity.

Have an open-source community [@nixgram](https://github.com/nixgram) on GitHub to help junior geeks. Work with versatile technology because that's my dream. Try to build up a habit to know what's going on under the hood until things do not seem like magic.<br> **I'm not a CP fanboy.**
